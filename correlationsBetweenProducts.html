				<h3 class="display-6">What the graphs show</h3>
		    <p class="lead">Below are graphs of the price differences over time of products that
				have a significant correlation. With these, it is possible to look more
				in-depth at the products and find explanations for some unlikely or
			 	unexpected correlations. For products with a lot of countries, graphs can quickly
				become cluttered. To get a better look, simply click on legend entries to hide them
				or enlarge a section. the name of each tab shows the products between
					which there is a correlation, the spearman value (smv) and the number of
					countries that have data for both products.</p>

		  <div class="container">
				<h3 class="display-6">Strong correlations between similar products</h3>
				<p class="lead">For a lot of the correlations we found the products were
					very similar to each other. This graph includes some of these products,
					like different kinds of meat, white and yellow maize, red and white onions
					and different qualities of wheat. Of course it makes sense that these products
					show a strong correlation.</p>

				<h3 class="display-6">Strong correlations between different products</h3>
				<p class="lead">We also found some correlations between different products, which
					can sometimes be hard to explain. Products like garlic and onions are different, but still grow
				under roughly the same conditions and can be used similarly in meals.
				Foods like cassava flour and rice are both major sources of carbohydrates, which is why the prices
				of these products influence each other.</p>

				<h3 class="display-6">Correlations that were found in only one country</h3>
				<p class="lead">In the previous graphs, we didn't include correlations between
					products that were just in one country, because the influence of the local economy causes
					a lot of products to have a stronger correlation than would be expected.
					This is why raised the minimum correlation value to 0.7 and plotted some of the products
					with the highest or most interesting correlations here.</p>
				<p class="lead">Especially Laos has a lot of high correlations between products that weren't
				found anywhere else. This is mostly because Laos has data for a lot of different kinds of meat and rice.
				More interesting are the negative correlations between catfish and other products. While most products
				cheaper since 2014, catfish became more expensive. By 2012, the catfish population had already dropped by 90%,
				but regional government intervention against fishing helped numbers bounce back a bit. However, in that year the building of the Xayaburi dam started.
				The catfish population there was predicted to go extict as a result of this, which probably caused the catfish price to increase,
			 	contrary to other products.</p>
