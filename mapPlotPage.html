		    <p class="lead"> Food prices are dependent on a lot of variables. Variables with a larger impact like production, location, time of year etc. For food security, it is important to predict the availability of food and thus the price of food. Before any predictions can be made about food prices, we need clarification about why food prices fluctuate. </p>

		    <p class="lead"> This page discusses the location of food and its local price. A crop needs ideal climatic conditions for its growth. As such, variable climatic conditions influence the price of food. Climatic conditions differ from place to place but do not stop at country borders. Therefore, food prices reasonably show some fluctuation per region. As such, we expect to find a positive correlation between food prices and their region. </p>

					The graphs shown above and below indicate the global price change of a product per country. Each year tab provides relevant information on the food price difference of that particular year. Most food prices vary between 0.3% and -0.3%. In addition, the graphs enable the user to hover over a datapoint in the global map to get more detailed information.

					To illustrate, in the year 2009, the food prices of wheat in the eastern part of Africa increased. However, taking a closer look at for instance West-Africa by zooming in on the map, it becomes clear that there are also some markets in the region where the food prices of wheat have decreased in 2009.

					Sometimes there is not a huge amout of datapoint. Bread is a product which is measured in just a few countries, but might help to support the hypothesis that foodprices influence each other by region. To back up this assumption, the year 2013 is illustrative.

					In 2012, the global food price of beef in the Central Africa-region was highly variable. Some markets on the map show a rise in the food price of beef, whereas others show a decline. Some markets are located very close to each other in the Central Africa-region. One explanation for this variety in food pricing might have to do with the ongoing (military) conflicts in the individual countries in the region. By example, The Democratic Republic of the Congo is very diverse in its pricing of beef.

		    <h1 class="display-4">Conclusion</h1>
		    <p class="lead">
					Analyzing the visual data does not give us a particular answer to the research question, which asks whether food prices of different products within certain regions are able to influence each other. In some cases, the food prices show a clustering such as in the bread price changes in 2013. In other cases, there is hardly any clustering, but more so there are random differences in food price changes.
				<p class="lead">
					To explain, there are three main explanations: 1) Differences in culture, 2) Conflicts in individual countries and, 3) Production of food. These three explanations are of course debatable, yet it can be clearly stated that changing regional food prices do not influence each other.
